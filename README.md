## Download

Add this to your project's `build.gradle`

```groovy
allprojects {
    repositories {
        maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
    }
}
```

And add this to your module's `build.gradle`

```groovy
dependencies {
	implementation 'com.github.esafirm.android-image-picker:imagepicker:x.y.z'
	// If you have a problem with Glide, please use the same Glide version or simply open an issue
	implementation 'com.github.bumptech.glide:glide:4.5.0'
}
```

change `x.y.z` to version in the [release page](https://github.com/esafirm/android-image-picker/releases)

# Usage

For full example, please refer to the `sample` app.

Also you can browse the issue labeled as question [here](https://github.com/esafirm/android-image-picker/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=label%3Aquestion+)

## Start image picker activity

The simplest way to start

```kotlin
val launcher = registerImagePicker {
	// handle result here
}

launcher.launch()
```

Complete features of what you can do with ImagePicker

```kotlin
val config = ImagePickerConfig {
	mode = ImagePickerMode.SINGLE // default is multi image mode
    language = "in" // Set image picker language
	theme = R.style.ImagePickerTheme

    // set whether pick action or camera action should return immediate result or not. Only works in single mode for image picker
    returnMode = if (returnAfterCapture) ReturnMode.ALL else ReturnMode.NONE

    isFolderMode = folderMode // set folder mode (false by default)
    isIncludeVideo = includeVideo // include video (false by default)
    isOnlyVideo = onlyVideo // include video (false by default)
    arrowColor = Color.RED // set toolbar arrow up color
    folderTitle = "Folder" // folder selection title
    imageTitle = "Tap to select" // image selection title
    doneButtonText = "DONE" // done button text
    limit = 10 // max images can be selected (99 by default)
    isShowCamera = true // show camera or not (true by default)
    savePath = ImagePickerSavePath("Camera") // captured image directory name ("Camera" folder by default)
    savePath = ImagePickerSavePath(Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory().path, isRelative = false) // can be a full path

    excludedImages = images.toFiles() // don't show anything on this selected images
    selectedImages = images  // original selected images, used in multi mode
}
```

If you want to call it outside `Activity` or `Fragment`, you can get the `Intent` with `createImagePickerIntent`

> Please note: handling in `onActivityResult` is not recommended since it's already deprecated in favor of the new result API

```kotlin
val intent = createImagePickerIntent(context, ImagePickerConfig())
startActivityForResult(intent, RC_IMAGE_PICKER)
```

## Receive result

when you're done picking images, result will be returned on launcher callback with type `List<Image>`. This list cannot be null but can be empty

```kotlin
val launcher = registerImagePicker { result: List<Image> ->
	result.forEach { image -> 
	  println(image)
	}
}    
```

## Camera Only

Use `CameraOnlyConfig` instead of `ImagePickerConfig`

```kotlin
val launcher = registerImagePicker { }
launcher.launch(CameraOnlyConfig())
```

You also still can use the `DefaultCameraModule` but discouraged to do it.
